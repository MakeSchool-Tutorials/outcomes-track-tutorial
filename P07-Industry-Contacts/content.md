Silicon Valley hiring is driven by who you know. **You can increase your potential for employment 3x by getting a warm introduction.**

For this reason it is critical that you start *building your network now* to better position yourself for jobs opportunities.

Past Make School students have regretted not building their network early enough.

Thankfully, this tutorial will help you *make connections* and *overcome* any fears of talking to real professionals.

# You ALREADY have connections at top companies

Strangely enough, you may know more people at a company than you think. To explain, I'll share a bit about network theory.

Sociologists call people in your immediate circle your **first degree connections**. These are people you interactive with frequently - friends, family, acquaintances.

The majority of your network is in **second degree connections** - the aggregate amount of people directly connected to your first degree connections.

Sociologists estimate that your number of second degree connections is X times greater than your number of first degree connections:

If you look through your second degree connections, you may find that you have second degree connections at practically every tech company in the valley - especially when you count the networks of Jeremy & Ashu (YC alums), and all the instructors.

All these companies are just a _single_ connection away.

How can you tap into these networks?
